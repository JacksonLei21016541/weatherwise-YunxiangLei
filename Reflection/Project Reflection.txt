The Weather Advisor project has been an exciting journey for me as a beginner in programming. I aimed to create a weather application that allows users to check current weather, view forecasts, visualize data through charts, and ask natural language questions like “Will it rain tomorrow?” For this project, I used two AI tools: ChatGPT and Grok. ChatGPT assisted with project management, such as organizing my tasks, and helped translate some conversations, mainly supporting Grok. Grok was my primary AI tool, responsible for solving most coding challenges and providing valuable suggestions, like recommending a hybrid approach combining a dashboard and chatbot.

I intentionally adopted several prompting strategies to ensure effective collaboration with the AI. For instance, I started by requesting code explanations to ensure I understood the logic, which helped me learn while coding. I also deliberately asked for pseudocode before implementation to grasp the structure of functions like parse_weather_question(). Additionally, I identified input/output requirements by asking for functions with specific inputs, such as city names, and outputs, like weather data. I challenged edge cases by asking, “What happens if the city name is empty?” and requested modular designs, such as splitting the user interface into smaller functions like display_welcome() and get_location_from_user(). These intentional strategies not only improved the code but also gave me a sense of learning while doing, which was incredibly rewarding.

I’m proud of how naturally I’ve adapted to using AI for IT learning. It now feels as intuitive as using Google used to be. For example, when I struggled with the natural language feature in Google Colab, I asked Grok to simplify it using rule-based parsing instead of an LLM, and it worked perfectly. This project taught me to break down complex tasks into manageable steps, making programming less daunting. Seeing my app function—displaying weather data, charts, and even answering questions—gave me a strong sense of accomplishment.

If I had more time, I’d love to write life-assistant code and explore using AI to learn Xcode for building apps, as I’m very interested in app development. Choosing to study IT has been immensely beneficial. Throughout this project, I often felt a sense of achievement because IT was something I always wanted to learn but never did. Mastering something I’m passionate about has brought me endless joy.
